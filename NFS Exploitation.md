# Understanding NFS (Network File System)

## What Is NFS?

NFS, short for **Network File System**, is a protocol that allows one system to share files and directories with other systems over a network. With NFS, users and applications can interact with remote files almost as if they were stored locally. This works by mounting an entire filesystem—or a specific portion of it—from a remote server onto a client machine. Once mounted, the client can access the shared files with whatever permissions have been assigned on the server side.

## How Does NFS Work?

### 1. Mounting a Remote Directory
A client begins by requesting to mount a directory from the NFS server, just like mounting a local storage device.  
This request is handled by the **mount service**, which uses **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)** to communicate with the server’s mount daemon.

### 2. Server Validation
The server checks whether the requesting user has permission to mount the directory.  
If allowed, the server returns a **file handle**, a unique identifier for each file or directory hosted on the server.

### 3. Accessing Files
When the client attempts to access a file through NFS:

An RPC request is sent to **NFSD** (the NFS daemon) on the server.  
This request includes:

- The file handle  
- The file name  
- The user’s UID  
- The user’s GID  

The server evaluates these values to determine what the user is allowed to do—such as reading or writing the file.

This permission-checking logic is what ultimately enforces user access rights.

## What Systems Use NFS?

Because NFS is a cross-platform protocol, it enables seamless file sharing between:

- Linux  
- macOS  
- UNIX  
- Windows (with NFS services installed)

A Windows Server machine can function as an NFS server for Linux/UNIX/macOS clients, and similarly, Windows can access shares hosted on a non-Windows NFS server.


In short, NFS acts as a universal bridge for file sharing across mixed operating-system environments.
