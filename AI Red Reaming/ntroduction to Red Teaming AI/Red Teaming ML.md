#Red Teaming ML-Based Systems

Machine Learning (ML) systems encounter distinct security challenges compared to traditional IT infrastructure, largely due to their reliance on massive datasets, complex model architectures, and statistical reasoning. 

Because exploiting these advanced systems requires techniques that take longer than standard testing windows, **red team assessments** are typically the preferred method for evaluating ML security.

**Key Assessment Challenges:**
* **Component Interactivity:** ML environments are built from multiple interconnected parts. Security flaws frequently emerge exactly where these components intersect. 
* **Scoping Limitations:** Defining the boundaries of a standard penetration test for an ML system is notoriously difficult.
* **Risk of Blind Spots:** A narrowly scoped test might accidentally skip over vital integration points, allowing critical vulnerabilities to remain completely undetected.
