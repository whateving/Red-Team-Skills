## **Competency Notes: AI, Machine Learning & Deep Learning**

### **1. Artificial Intelligence (AI): The "Big Picture"**
AI is the broad science of creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. Instead of just following rigid instructions, AI allows computers to "think" and solve problems.

**Key Capabilities:**
* **Reasoning:** Solving puzzles and making logical decisions.
* **Perception:** Understanding the world through visual or audio inputs.
* **Learning:** improving based on past experiences.

**Core Domains of AI:**
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Computers understanding and speaking human language (e.g., Chatbots, Translators).
* **Computer Vision:** Computers "seeing" and analyzing images/video (e.g., Facial recognition).
* **Robotics:** Machines performing physical tasks autonomously.
* **Expert Systems:** Software that mimics the decision-making of a human specialist.
* **Cybersecurity Application:** Automatically identifying and stopping cyber threats before they cause damage.

### **2. Machine Learning (ML): The "Brain" of AI**
Machine Learning is a specific subset of AI. Instead of being explicitly programmed for every single rule, ML algorithms analyze data to find patterns. They "learn" from this data to make predictions or decisions.

**The Three Pillars of ML:**

**A. Supervised Learning (Learning with a Teacher)**
* **How it works:** The system learns from "labeled" data (data with the correct answers attached).
* **Real-world use:**
    * **Spam Detection:** Taught by seeing emails marked "Spam" vs. "Not Spam."
    * **Image Classification:** Taught by seeing images labeled "Cat" vs. "Dog."

**B. Unsupervised Learning (Self-Discovery)**
* **How it works:** The system analyzes "unlabeled" data to find hidden structures or patterns on its own.
* **Real-world use:**
    * **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers by purchasing behavior without being told the groups beforehand.
    * **Anomaly Detection:** Spotting weird data points (crucial for **Cybersecurity**).

**C. Reinforcement Learning (Trial and Error)**
* **How it works:** The system learns by interacting with an environment and getting "rewards" for good actions or "penalties" for bad ones.
* **Real-world use:** Game playing, Robotics, and Autonomous Driving.

### **3. Deep Learning (DL): The "Advanced Brain"**
Deep Learning is a specialized subset of Machine Learning. It attempts to mimic the human brain's structure using **Artificial Neural Networks**. It is incredibly powerful for handling messy, complex data like video, audio, and long text.

**How it works:**
It uses multiple layers of processing (hence "Deep") to extract features from data automatically.

**Key Architectures:**
* **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks):** The standard for **Images**. They are great at recognizing patterns like edges, shapes, and objects.
* **RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks):** The standard for **Sequential Data**. They have a "memory" that makes them good for time-series data or speech.
* **Transformers:** The modern standard for **Language (NLP)**. They handle long-range context exceptionally well (this is the tech behind GPT).

### **4. The Relationship Hierarchy**
How these fit together:

1.  **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the outer shell (The broad concept).
2.  **Machine Learning (ML)** is inside AI (The method of learning).
3.  **Deep Learning (DL)** is inside ML (The specialized, powerful technique).

**Synergy in Action (Real-world Examples):**
* **Autonomous Driving:** Uses **CNNs (DL)** to see the road, **Supervised Learning (ML)** to classify signs, and **AI** logic to make navigation decisions.
* **Cybersecurity:** Uses **AI** to scan networks, **Unsupervised Learning (ML)** to detect new/unknown anomalies, and **DL** to analyze malware code patterns.
