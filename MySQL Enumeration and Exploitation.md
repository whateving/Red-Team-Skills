# Understanding MySQL

## What Is MySQL?

**MySQL** is a type of **relational database management system (RDBMS)** that uses **SQL (Structured Query Language)** to store and work with data.  
Let’s break those terms down:

### **Database**
A database is an organised, long-term storage system for structured data.

### **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**
This is software that creates and manages databases using the **relational model**, where data is stored in **tables**.  
Tables relate to each other through **keys**, such as *primary keys* and *foreign keys*.

### **SQL (Structured Query Language)**
SQL is the language used to communicate with relational databases.  
MySQL uses SQL commands to create tables, insert data, update records, and more.

> MySQL is simply the **brand name** of one of the most widely used SQL-based database systems.  
Other SQL-based systems include **PostgreSQL**, **MariaDB**, and **Microsoft SQL Server**.

## How Does MySQL Work?

MySQL operates using a **client–server model**, and consists of:

- **The MySQL server** → handles requests, processes queries, and manages data  
- **Utility programs / clients** → tools that send SQL commands to the server

Here’s the basic workflow:

1. **MySQL creates a database** to store tables and define how they relate.  
2. **Clients send SQL statements** (commands) to perform actions like selecting, inserting, or updating data.  
3. **The server executes the request**, processes the query, and sends back the result.

The MySQL server is responsible for:

- Creating databases and tables  
- Managing data access  
- Handling queries efficiently  
- Enforcing rules and relationships between tables

## What Runs MySQL?

MySQL is extremely flexible and can run on:

- **Linux**
- **Windows**
- **macOS**
- Many server distributions

It is one of the most popular databases for websites and applications.  
MySQL is also a core part of the well-known **LAMP stack**:

- **L**inux  
- **A**pache  
- **M**ySQL  
- **P**HP/Python/Perl  

This stack powers a large portion of the modern web.
